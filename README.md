  # OBS Video Capture
This is a simple Python script that captures video from OBS Studio using the OpenCV library. It displays the video in a window and allows you to quit the application by pressing 'q'.


  ### Prerequisites
Make sure you have OBS Studio installed and the obs-virtualcam plugin enabled to use OBS as a virtual camera.

Additionally, ensure you have the required dependencies installed using one of the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  or

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```


  ### Usage
Run the script [capture.py](capture.py):
```bash
python capture.py
```

Ensure that the OBS Studio virtual camera is activated.

Press 'q' to exit the application.
